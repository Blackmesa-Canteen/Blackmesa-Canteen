I can work efficiently with:
- Java, Python, JavaScript, C#, C;

I'd like to be:
- Back-end developer. I can work with Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, MyBatis, Redis, Docker, Node.js, Python Flask, PyQt5, .NET and so on. I have taken several group projects. I also worked for a computer vision project in Python and a parallel computing project with MPI pattern.
- Full-stack developer. It is challenging, but I'm eager to learn and enjoy it;
- I can also work as a front-end developer. I used to build up several projects with jQuery, bootstrap and React.js. however, I'm not so good at css styling and aesthetics stuff though.
- Life-long learner. I'm happy to learn new things and solving problems with knowledge.
- Rich (Not a chance).

Language:
- Mandarin Chinese;
- English.
- Japanese (Only a tiny of)
